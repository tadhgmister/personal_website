I'm so glad that we are different
I would hate to be the same
I just want to be peculiar

How can I get this through
Nobody can be like you
Don't compare yourself to no one
cause they can't do what you've done
to thine own self be true

eh

in this world full of confusion
public pain and disillusion
don't let them dim your shine
you go for yours I'll go for mine
still a beautiful world and we'll be fine

(let me tell you what my mama says)
[Chorus]
<i style="background-color:yellow;">Just be yourself
cause everyone else is taken
don't be afraid
all you need to do is come as you are
you'll never be lonely
if you can _reach/read_ somebody's problems
Everybody's live is precious so protect us all, don't let us fall
cause we all bleed the same</i>
[end chorus]

Don't ever change the things you do
you just keep on loving you
I know you're tired of abuse
and you say it ain't no use
don't believe it, it ain't true.

cause it don't matter what they say
I'm going to love you anyway
we might not have it all together
but together we have it all
so if we stumble we won't fall

<i style="background-color:yellow;">[Chrous]</i>
we all bleed the same * 5 extra
everybody's live is precious so protect it all, don't let us fall
we all bleed the same

I'm so glad that we are different
I would hate to be the same
I just want to be peculiar
Lest the world would be estranged
what does that even mean?
Does anybody know?
I just want to be the real me
Instead of putting on a show

<i style="background-color:yellow;">[Chrous]</i>

-Love each other *3
-stop the hate
-> *3
love each other *3

<i style="background-color:yellow;">[Chrous]</i>
[we all bleed the same layered with "love each other" several times]
