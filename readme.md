## Interesting things I've done
- Wrote the html for this website by hand
- For the 4th year project in Systems engineering our team designed a wearable watch to collect biometrics, I wrote the program to offload the data from the device and log / graph it for demonstration.
- [youtube walkthrough][ytCoordBox] of multi-threaded data structure analysis (made in the context of being a TA and wanting to help students understand how to analyze their code for correctness)
- [youtube video][ytcache] of brief overview of different forms of caching (expects a lot of prior knowledge)
- a clock based on getting the current time as a real number of days between 0 and 1 and then representing it in:
    - [dozonal with normal clock display + dozonal cheatsheet][clock]
    - [dozonal (base 12) recursively nesting][clockDozRec] so each block's area directly represents how much time it represents.
    - [decimal (base 10) similarly recursive][clockDecRec]
- [github issues for typescript][typescriptAuthored] that I've authored including a
	  [viable proposal][tsInheritProposal] to one of typescripts longest outstanding limitations
- [contributions to eslint-typescript][eslintTSAuthored] including an interesting case where the solution was to [educate the users][eslintTSEducate] instead of 'fixing' their code
- [solved an obscure python issue][pythonTBWith] where certain cases error messages would point to a very misleading line numbers, the files linked at [the top of that page][pythonTBWithCode] are the codes I wrote to fix the issue, this didn't fix the core language but it paved the way for other maintainers to fix.
- [bookSUSAN](bookSUSAN/index.html): animated children's story written for grade 10 english
- [scriptable calculator](https://github.com/tadhgmister/Calculator_Awesome) that was immensely helpful in university physics, unfortunately the version that supported unit conversions and error propagation and derivatives has been lost.
- ["scoops" as a unit of volume using base 12](scoops.html) to simplify cooking

<!-- - unicycling, backflips, swimming in wave pools-->
- rubix cube variants like the [super skewb](https://www.puzzlemaster.ca/browse/cubepuzzle/7774-skewb-xtreme-10-color-edition), the [ghost cube](https://ruwix.com/twisty-puzzles/3x3x3-rubiks-cube-shape-mods-variations/ghost-cube/), and a lot of others. I take pride in having never looked up any algorithms for any of these and enjoy finding interesting colour patterns once I found a solution 
- casual but inventive puzzle video games like [Portal 2](https://www.thinkwithportals.com/about.php), [HyperRogue](https://zenorogue.itch.io/hyperrogue), [Toki Tori 2+](https://store.steampowered.com/app/201420/Toki_Tori_2/), and [Baba is You](https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/)
- didn't make but love to play [3D minesweeper with double the number of mines compared to the "hard" difficulty](http://egraether.com/mine3d/beta/?mainAlpha=0.9&hoverAlpha=0.6&grid=10,10,10,200&backgroundColor=#330000)
- board games like [Concept](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/147151/concept). [Renegade](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/170604/renegade), and [Resistance](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41114/resistance)
- tinkering with a [linux configuration](https://github.com/tadhgmister/dotfiles) that is personalized and reproducible 
- web comics: [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/), [Strong Female Protagonist](https://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-1/page-0/), and [OOTS (D&D themed and very silly)](https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0001.html)
